Mozy is a suite of loosely linked libraries for achieving "things" in PHP. Moxy\Router is a lightweight, extensible Router which can support simple and complex routing strategies, across any type of request (HTTP or otherwise).

It is designed to allow extension of all aspects of the routing; whether it is in the dispatcher, request or response. Heavy use of Dependency Injection allows customisation beyond the defaults.

Included in the Library are some simple, common, Routing strategies (for example, static routes). Other routing strategies built on Moxy\Router can be found in companion packages such as Moxy\REST.
